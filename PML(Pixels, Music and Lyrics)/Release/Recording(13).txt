From Friday Night
to Sunday afternoon
from happy!
to sad!!
from life to death
Oh! the circle of life
it never change
			
So what are we doing?
Can't we see
We got to show Love
To our neighbors
To our enemies
Cherish those moments
Go out of our way
Cause the circle of life
Will come to those
And Everyone will die one day
So put up your hand in the fight for love
And let me here you say........
			
Oh I want to love tonight!
Oh I want to love tonight...
Help my brother out that fight!
Get my sister into the light
Oh! I want to fight!
			
Fight for my right
Fight for the love
Fight for the truth
And do it right
Oh! tonight,
I'm going to fight!
